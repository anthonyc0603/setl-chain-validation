Fixed and improved the behaviour of the "floor", "ceil", "round" and "roundHE" functions in contracts. These functions now take a second optional parameter which determines the number of decimal places to round to. For example:

floor(35.622)     = 35.000
floor(35.622,  2) = 35.620
floor(35.622, -1) = 30.00
